Repository for the example app of Thoughtbot's Rails Testing book.

My goals in going through this book:
* learn test-driven development in Rails
* learn the tools/frameworks used to do test-driven development
* apply the things I learned to my current and future Rails-based projects
* have a solid foundation in testing web applications written in Ruby on Rails

Here I try to apply the concepts taught in the book to a Rails 6 "Reddat" app.  
Thank you @thoughtbot for [this book](https://books.thoughtbot.com/assets/testing-rails.pdf).
